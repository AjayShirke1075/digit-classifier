# Digit Classifier

This is a Python project using PyTorch and Streamlit to classify hand-drawn digits from uploaded images.

## Features
- Upload or draw digits on canvas
- Pretrained PyTorch model for digit recognition
- Streamlit-based user interface

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements using: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app using: streamlit run app.py

## Problem Statement
In many real-world applications such as form automation, postal mail sorting, and banking (like reading handwritten checks), interpreting handwritten digits accurately and automatically is critical. Manually sorting and interpreting these digits is slow, error-prone, and inefficient.
This project aims to solve that problem using a deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset. The model can take an image or drawing of a digit (0–9) and recognize it accurately using PyTorch.

## Use Cases
🏦 Banking: Recognize handwritten digits on checks and forms.

✉️ Postal Services: Automate zip code and postal code reading.

📚 Educational Tools: Build interactive tools for students to learn digit recognition and AI.

📋 Form Processing: Automatically digitize and interpret scanned paper forms.

🤖 Robotics/IoT: Enable devices to understand hand-drawn digits from sensor input.
